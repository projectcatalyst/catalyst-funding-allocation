  Analysis of how funding is categorised in the Catalyst funding process for the
  Cardano treasury with suggested improvements to funding categorisation
---

# Overview



Funding categories were creating to create a simple and effective solution for doing funding categorisation for the Catalyst funding process. Funding categories were created as a result of the [funding categorisation analysis](https://app.gitbook.com/o/Pr76HeHUxsbctwx0OULs/s/vZLnuW1KMXXsbdPSzee1/).



Funding categories were created to be a simpler and effective way to do funding categorisation. Idea funding categories are broad, inclusive, recurring and unique - they allow for any type of idea to be submitted.

### **Category types**

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/funding-categories-groupings-explained.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Idea categories**

Any proposal with an idea, initiative or innovation can be submitted into these categories. Example ideas could include events, applications, tools, software libraries, community initiative efforts and many others.



**Contributor categories**

Proposals submitted by people in the community who want to work full time in the ecosystem to support and improve the ecosystem.

****

**Governance & Identity**

Governance & Identity focusses on proposals that will help with improve and support both Catalyst and the wider ecosystem around how governance and identity is used in different communities such as through from different tools, libraries, SDKs, processes or research.

****

**Development & Infrastructure**

Development & Infrastructure focuses on proposals that will help improve and maintain the Cardano developer ecosystem with tools, scripts, libraries and SDKs that make it easier for developers to build applications. It also includes infrastructure improvements with tools and resources that will make it as easy as possible for community members to secure and scale the network and run their own infrastructure and stake pool nodes.

**Nurturing Ideas & Teams**

Nurturing Ideas & Teams is about exploring how we can help to foster growth for ideas and new teams forming in the ecosystem. Any proposal type is welcomed as long as it is about the Cardano ecosystem in someway. There is a $40,000 maximum budget for proposals which helps to increase the number and diversity of teams and ideas that can be funded.

**Catalyst Contributors**

[Catalyst contributors](https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-contributors/) help with people who want to be paid to become a full time contributor in the Catalyst ecosystem to support and improve the Catalyst ecosystem. This can include helping with development, coordination, analysis, QA & auditing, marketing, product or design.

[Cardano contributors](https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/cardano-contributors/) is for people who want to be paid to work as full time contributors in the Cardano ecosystem. This includes those who want to help support improving the stake pool ecosystem and the Cardano developer ecosystem. Contributors would help analyse, coordinate or develop tools, libraries and SDKs for the ecosystem to use.

Catalyst Native is a model used in Catalyst where external communities can setup their own funding challenge with an allotted budget for proposals. These challenges set by these communities may or not be recurring and may only be included for one funding round.
