# Budget Weighting Considerations

The following are some reasons for and against having a larger first round of budget weighting for each of the [funding categories](../funding-categories/categories/) that have been suggested.&#x20;



### Community & Outreach

**Reasons for a larger initial budget weighting**

* Need for community wide discussion around how ecosystem gets implemented and operates.
* A need for outreach to new collaborators or community members to help grow the number of people involved in the ecosystem.

**Reasons for a smaller initial budget weighting**

* Products and integrations are beneficial to helping form communities to solve and iterate on defined problems.
* The ecosystem currently has limited amount of applications which could cause increased churn any outreach efforts in the short term.

****

### **Products & Integrations**

**Reasons for a larger initial budget weighting**

* Cardano needs more use cases through applications and integrations that will help drive adoption.

**Reasons for a smaller initial budget weighting**

* Developer ecosystem currently lacks a wide range of tools, libraries and SDKs. This makes it more difficult to develop applications on the Cardano ecosystem in the short term until more of the development ecosystem is implemented.



### Catalyst Ecosystem

**Reasons for a larger initial budget weighting**

* Catalyst is currently very centralised relying on IOG and Ideascale. More tools and processes that help the community can operate are needed to move more governance control over to the community.
* There is a lack of governance and identity tools and processes that can help applications building on Cardano to have more effective ways to decentralize their applications.

**Reasons for a smaller initial budget weighting**

* ?



### Catalyst Contributors

**Reasons for a larger initial budget weighting**

* New tools and processes are needed to help the community take more ownership of the governance process.
* The Catalyst process is labour intensive and requires more people supporting how it operates.
* Contributors have an objective to help with collaboration which can help to reduce the amount of duplicated efforts of any developments happening in the Catalyst ecosystem.

**Reasons for a smaller initial  budget weighting**

* The contributor funding approach has not been tested in practice using a first round of contributors yet.



### Cardano Ecosystem

**Reasons for a larger initial budget weighting**

* New scripts, tools, libraries and SDKs are needed to make it easier to develop and deploy applications onto the Cardano blockchain.
* The developer ecosystem will become the backbone of what DApps will use to build on top of the blockchain. Enough funding is required to pay for highly skilled developers that can produce secure and maintainable open source code.
