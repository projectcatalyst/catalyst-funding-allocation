# Catalyst & Broad Categories

The [funding allocation approaches](broad-vs-specific-categorisation.md) analysis explored the tradeoffs for categorising funding between broad and specific approaches.

Based on that analysis broad categories appear to be a suitable choice for being a simple yet effective way to categorise treasury funding distribution. The following analysis will look at the factors that make broad categories a good allocation approach.



### Objectives

Objectives to consider for improving how funding is allocated:

* **Targeted funding** - The community benefit from having a way to direct funding to where it is most needed in the ecosystem that will produce the highest impact.
* **Maximise innovation opportunity** - The ecosystem benefits from ensuring the best ideas and talent are able to access funding in an open, fair and efficient funding process.



### Catalyst and specific categories

**Requires governance tool for budget weighting and category selection decisions**

To use specific categories, such as the challenge setting process currently being used, there is a need for better tooling to select categories effectively that prevents overlapping duplicates and also helps set the budget weightings for each challenge. Tools for this process need to more effectively capture data and reasoning from a mixture of sources to help guide well informed decisions of why one category may be more important than another. This is non trivial to execute due to how fast the ecosystem changes and the amount of data that would be needed to effectively prove that one category is more important than another. The existing process for Catalyst only helps with dealing with the selection of challenges. Currently it doesn't deal with pulling together balanced evidence for each potential area in the ecosystem nor does it help with deciding on budget weightings. Information and governance tools would be needed to more effectively decide on setting specific challenges.



**Restrictive funding caused by current challenge setting process**

The current tools and processes for creating challenges has led to areas of the ecosystem that get little to no funding for a given funding round. This is highly problematic as it can cause stagnation in innovation for key areas and goes against the objective of maximising the opportunity for innovation in the ecosystem. To restrict funding and force it into one area of the ecosystem there would need to be a high amount of supporting evidence that funding innovation in that area would be more beneficial than another. This is difficult to prove and comes with a high cost as it can restrict access to funding for other impactful innovation.



### Catalyst and broad categories

**Requires governance tool for budget weighting decisions**

The use of broad categories would not need the same tools for justifying each category. The combination of all the broad categories should be inclusive of all forms of idea and innovation. The only main tool that would be needed is for helping decide on the budget weighting allocation applied to each of the categories.



**Directing funding with better tagging and curated proposal lists**

Proposals require votes from the Cardano community to get funding. The simplest way to direct funding is through the community voting on proposals they want to see funded. Broad categories mean the competition is greater for proposals. This is good for letting the best ideas compete for funding. The downside is smaller proposal teams need ways for their proposal to be promoted for awareness. Tagging proposals with what they are about as well as curated proposal lists around a given topic are two improvements that can help with improving how the community can have awareness of the different proposal areas and direct funding more effectively through their voting choice.



**Inclusive for all ideas and innovation**

A key benefit for broad categories is they can more easily be inclusive of all forms of innovation and ideas. Giving the entire community equal access to opportunity for funding increases the amount of fair competition between proposals.

**Less stakeholder effort**&#x20;

Broad categories are easier to manage and govern over specific category challenges. Here is how broad categories would effect the different stakeholders:

* **Voters** - No need to understand the entire ecosystem to make well informed decisions about where funding should be allocated. No need to spend time reading all challenge settings to make well informed decisions. No time needed to vote on challenge settings. More capacity would be available to spend time deciding on which proposals should be funded.
* **Community advisors** - No need to assess a large number of challenge setting proposals. Removes the need to understand a large number of challenges before they make assessments for a given funding round. More capacity would be available to produce more assessments on proposals that are looking for funding.
* **Veteran community advisors** - No need to assess all the assessments made on challenge settings. More capacity would be available to review the assessments concerning proposals that are looking for funding.
* **Proposers** - No need to spend time trying to document why one area of the ecosystem requires funding. No more time spent creating challenge setting proposals that would already be covered by broad categories.



### Summary

* **Lower stakeholder effort** - There is less effort required from each stakeholders by removing the governance complexities of setting specific categories. Using broad categories results in more time being available to spend in improving the decisions made for proposals looking for funding and improving the governance system itself.
* **Less governance effort** - Broad categories only require governance on budget weighting for each main category. No tool is initially needed to justify every challenge that is being suggested which is currently what should be introduced with the current challenge setting process.
* **More inclusive for innovation** - Broad categories are more effective at being more inclusive for all forms of idea and innovation.
* **Funding can become more directed** - Voters still get to choose what to vote on so being able to direct funding exists for whichever approach of funding allocation is used. The lower effort and increased simplicity are the key benefits. The use of better tagging and curated lists are also available for helping promote important proposals that help to improve how voters direct the funding.
* **Budget weighting governance tool** - Whether broad categories or more specific categories are used for funding allocation there is still a need for a governance tool to help with more effectively deciding on the budget weightings for each funding category.&#x20;
* **Only add complexity when the benefits are clear** - Using specific categories such as the current challenge setting process adds significant complexity without any profound benefit over the use of broad categories. Complexity should be avoided and simplicity saves time and resources. When clear benefits can be defined the increases in complexity could then be justified.
