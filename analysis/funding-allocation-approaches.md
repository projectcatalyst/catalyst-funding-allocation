# Funding Allocation Approaches

### Funding allocation: broad vs specific

There are a number of ways that funding could be allocated to distribute the Cardano treasury funding. One very important factor is how broad or specific the categorisation of that funding allocation is.

**No categories -** Funding goes through a single grouped process. Proposals compete with every other proposal.



**Broad categories -** Funding is allocated between a small number of broad categories with a larger budget weighting applied to each of them. Examples categories include Products & Integrations, Catalyst ecosystem and Cardano ecosystem.



**Specific categories -** Funding is allocated between a moderate amount of specific categories with smaller budget weightings applied to each of them. Example categories include AI & machine learning, transportation or DeFi.



**Very specific categories** - Funding is allocated between a large number of very specific categories with much smaller budget weightings applied to each of them. Example categories could be Japan local events, DeFi in Botswana or IoT for agriculture farming.



### **Factors to consider for categorisation**

* **Open or restrictive funding** - How hard or easy is it for all forms of ideas and innovation to request funding due to the categorisation being used?
* **Budget weighting complexity** - What complexity is there for deciding the budget weightings for each of the categories in a funding round? How much effort and how long will it take to get a well informed outcome?
* **Categorisation justification** - How complex is it to provide evidence and data to justify all categorisation selected for a given funding round? How much effort and governance is required?&#x20;
* **Proposal visibility** - How easy is it for proposals to be seen? Is there high competition causing lower visibility?
* **Directing funding** - How effective is the categorisation for directing funding to certain areas that need more funding support?



### No categories

**Advantages**

* **Very open funding** - Any team with any idea could make a proposal as there are no categories restricting where funding must be allocated.
* **No budget weighting complexity** - All funding is available in one process meaning no allocation complexity is present in each funding round.
* **No categorisation justification** - Community doesn't need to justify any categories each funding round meaning the community saves time and effort.

**Issues**

* **Very low proposal visibility** - With just one category it becomes hard for individual proposals to stand out against all other proposal teams. This results in a high need for better tagging and community curated lists for small proposals to get better visibility.
* **No directing funding** - No effort is made to steer funding into a certain area for the wider ecosystem. This could result in more popular areas repeatedly receiving more funding than is needed.



### **Broad categories**

**Advantages**

* **Open funding** - Funding is very open as any area in the ecosystem should be able to create proposals into one of the broad categories. Broad categories would only be slightly restrictive as they will have a budget allocated to them meaning only a certain amount of proposals could be funded for a given category.
* **Low budget weighting complexity** - Usage of only a few categories results in a low complexity for determining what amount of funding should be allocated to each one.
* **Low categorisation justification** - Broad categories can allow any type of proposal to be added meaning there is low justification on why the categories are used in each funding round as they are inclusive to all ideas and innovation.

**Issues**

* **Difficult to direct funding** - Directing the funding is more difficult as more types of proposals are competing under the same category. It is down to the voters for directing funding when deciding which proposals to vote on.
* **Low proposal visibility** - Having only a few broad categories makes it hard for some proposals to stand out against larger more established teams. There could be a need for some form of tagging and community curated lists to help aid in visibility for smaller teams.



### **Specific categories**

**Advantages**

* **Good proposal visibility** - Proposals would generally have less competition for a specific challenge making it easier to get proposal visibility due to the categorisation.
* **Directing funding** - Using more specific categories makes it easier to allocate funding to certain areas in the ecosystem.

**Issues**

* **Restrictive funding** - Funding can only be requested by proposals in the categories that are selected. This makes funding more restrictive and also doesn't mean there is any guarantee that an effective team will make proposals in that category. This increases risk of funding being deployed to lower quality proposals.
* **High budget weighting complexity** - Every extra specific category makes it more complex to determine what amount of budget should be allocated to each area in the ecosystem.
* **High categorisation justification** - Every extra specific category makes it more complex to justify why those specific categories are more important than other potential ones that could be used.&#x20;



### Resolving issues for broader categories

**Improving proposal visibility**

Two easy ways to help improve the proposal visibility would be using effective tagging for proposals and curated lists. Better tagging of proposals would mean it would be easier to group proposals based on common topics such as finance, agriculture or legal focussed proposals. Curated lists are another way where community members could create and share lists of proposals about a given topic to highlight ones the community benefit from reading about before voting. Curated lists could also mix well with the potential use of experts from different market segments.

**Improve ability to direct funding**

One way that funding could be directed better to certain areas in the ecosystem is by creating a governance system for the community to vote on which areas they believe require the most attention. This could also include qualitative information. The results could then be made available to the wider community during funding rounds so people are aware of the thoughts of different people in the community to take that information into account when voting on proposals.

### **Resolving issues for specific categories**

**Preventing restrictive funding**

One way this could be achieved is to ensure that all the specific categories cover the same areas that broad categories would achieve. The problem with this is it adds significant complexity to the budget weighting and also makes the budgets highly restrictive as only fixed amounts of funding would be distributed to each area.



**Reducing budget weighting complexity**

It is difficult to decide how much funding should be directed to each of the selected specific categories. To resolve this issue there would need to be a process to gather a sufficient amount of data and justification to support decisions on which area require more funding than others. A governance process **** is also needed to decide on final budget weighting allocations.



**Reducing categorisation justification**

To resolve the issue of needing to justify the categories there would need to be sufficient data and reasoning over the tradeoffs of allocating funding to one area over another so that well informed decisions can be made. To do this effectively it may need experts from each category area to showcase and highlight current progress and how new or existing projects in those areas would benefit from further funding.



### Summary

* **Specificity adds budget complexity** - The more categories that get added to the funding round process the more complex it becomes to determine a sensible budget to allocate to each category.
* **Specificity adds justification complexity** - The more categories that get added to a funding round the more difficult it gets to justify why that category is more important than any other category that may be being excluded.
* **Easier to solve proposal visibility and directing funding issues** - Better tagging, curated lists and gathering community feedback can be effective ways to organise and distribute information to the community that help solve issues for broader categorisation around proposal visibility and how funding is directed to certain areas.
* **Broader categorisation takes far less effort and governance** - Less information, governance and tools are needed for more broad categorisation as there's less effort needed for justifying the categories and the budget that each one has.
