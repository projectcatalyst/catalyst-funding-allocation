# Proposal Inspiration & Encouragement

### Inspiration for new ideas

What can the community and wider Catalyst process integrate to most effectively help proposers think of new ideas to turn into proposals?



**Lessons learnt from challenge settings**

Something to highlight from the challenge setting process is that the community uses its own initiative to create proposals based on the information they have to suggest areas that would benefit from further funding.

The benefit of the community writing these proposals are it can be effective at bringing awareness to the community about things happening in the ecosystem, problems that need solving or data and insights on the subject area. This information flow can help lead to creating ideas for the potential proposers looking at these challenges.

However this written content does not need to be attached to the a challenge setting that puts a mandate on where funding should be allocated to achieve the same effect.

The issue with challenge setting in this regard is that the proposal team only has their own view point of what the ecosystem needs. As the ecosystem grows increasingly over time it will mean proposal teams will struggle to understand the full needs of the ecosystem.

A ecosystem that is constantly growing will make it increasingly difficult for any challenge team to be able to define an appropriate budget for a challenge setting as there are an increasing number of variables that they should know about to make a well informed suggestion. This is also an issue for voters who would also need to be more well informed if the challenge settings mean restricting funding from one area over another.

The solution to this problem is to simply not attach the budget allocation to the challenge settings which are increasingly likely over time to be more difficult to justify as a priority due to the growing complexities of the ecosystem. As an alternative communities can create community reports to achieve the same goal of sharing quality information flow to generate ideas as detailed below.



**Community reports**

Communities that form around a certain topic could add value by producing reports to help inform the rest of the community on that area. The reports could cover problems, data, insights, ideas or priorities. Data could come from the ecosystem usage or existing funded proposals. Problems and insight could come from observation, community feedback or through analysing data.

If executed to a high standard these reports could be effective for inspiring new ideas on what type of proposals the ecosystem would benefit from. These reports offer a similar approach to writing challenge settings by detailing out a problem area to address in the ecosystem. However community reports could become both more diverse with inclusions of data and insights and also more refined to a high quality that is updated repeatedly to make an effective approach to inform the community and inspire new ideas.



**Problem consensus voting**

Doing democratic votes from the community on which problems exist and which ones are the most important in the short term could be a great way to indicate what proposals would be good ideas to propose in the Catalyst funding process.

### Encouraging more proposal submissions

What approaches can be used to encourage more people to submit proposals?

**Lessons learnt from challenge settings**

Challenge settings were effective at creating a call to action to potential proposers. The challenges that got set were always changing so the proposer could not be certain it would appear again. This scarcity of funding for specific areas could be seen as an effective way to encourage proposers to take action and propose solutions for these more specific areas in the ecosystem.

The problem with this attachment of challenges to budgets is there is a fixed amount of funding available in total each round. From that funding available only a certain number of challenges can get voted in which means other areas can often be excluded. This puts increasing pressure on the challenge for it to be correct that it is indeed a good focus area for funding and also pressure that proposals of a high enough standard must present themselves in this time period. Another issue is how areas excluded from the funding challenges selected may have better innovation in different areas. If these proposers are not able to access funding fast enough they may find alternatives in different ecosystems where funding may be more readily available.

Catalyst as a funding process needs to be careful in how it incentivises more proposals to be submitted and if that approach could negatively impacts other potential opportunities and options that the voters may want to choose from.

**Priority consensus voting**

Using democratic voting the community could indicate what areas of the ecosystem they believe to be the highest priority. This information for a proposal could help to generate the confidence and support that they should submit a proposal when their project matches the priorities of the community vote. The benefit of this approach is also that the priority vote outcome doesn't create a mandate on funding allocation. There would be no risk of stagnating the funding distribution when no proposal opportunities turn up in the short term.

**Bonus funding incentives**

A bonus funding incentive is the idea that the community could use funds to put up a bonus for proposals that address a certain challenge set by a community vote. Funds could come from Catalyst, rapid funding mechanisms, the community or from project teams who want a particular problem solved. For instance if a social network was the priority for the community a 10% funding bonus could be given to any proposal that gets funded through the Catalyst process that is working on a social network. This creates a bigger incentive for proposers to think about and submit proposals that address this challenge. The benefit of an approach like this is it would supplement the existing process and puts no pressure on innovation presenting itself immediately. Instead the funding would be distributed when the conditions are met for that bonus. Another benefit is the same funding could be attached to multiple bonus incentives so there is flexibility in where that small bonus get allocated. There could be a number of other alternative approaches such as based on KPIs or execution that could determine how this bonus incentive works.



**Rapid funding distribution**

Using rapid funding mechanisms could be an effective way to fund proposals that solve problems or capture opportunities when those proposals are more time sensitive. A community governance process could make the funds available to whoever can propose and implement a solution to the task.



**Quadratic funding**

[Quadratic funding](https://wtfisqf.com) can be an effective tool to more effectively distribute funding to projects or causes in a more democratic way. There is a need to solve the issues around [sybil resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil\_attack) by including one or multiple ways for the voters to verify they are a person. The use of quadratic funding could be applied to create incentives for people to solve certain problems or improve certain areas of the ecosystem.&#x20;



**Marketing**

Currently only a small amount of marketing has been explored for attracting people into the Catalyst funding process. There are a large number of approaches to trial and determine which could be effective as approaches to attract new proposers.
