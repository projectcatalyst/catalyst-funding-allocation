# Small Budget Proposals

### Broad categorisation problems

Broad categorisation is effective at ensuring all forms of ideas and innovation can be submitted to the Catalyst funding process. However by having larger categories there is a knock on effect from more competition from existing teams. This could have some knock on effects for those with fewer resources and also ensuring new ideas and unknown teams are visible in each broader category.



**Increase difficulty for people with fewer resources**

Broad categorisation is [egalitarian in theory](egalitarian-funding-categorisation.md) but can be unfair for some proposers in practice that have [fewer resources](proposers-with-fewer-resources.md). When competition is higher this can make it more difficult for people with fewer resources to compete with producing proposals as effectively as those with more resources.

**Decreased visibility of unknown teams or new ideas**

If existing funded proposers are well known and have been effectively delivering against previous proposals then this could have the impact of making it easier for that team to get funding in the future. This can have a negative knock on impact for new proposal teams who have to compete with more established teams. New ideas from unknown teams may struggle to get initial exposure and access to capital to prove their ideas are of importance.



### Nurturing Ideas & Teams category

A new category has been added called Nurturing Ideas & Teams to address some of the concerns around just using broad categories to cover all forms of ideas.

Introduction of a category specifically focussed on supporting new ideas and teams can be a solution to the difficult that could emerge from larger categories. Here are the two main bits of criteria for this category:



**Any proposal idea**

* The category should allow for any idea to be submitted to maximise the chance of finding new and useful approaches.
* The only requirement for proposals is it should be Cardano related as the funding is coming from the Cardano ecosystem through community votes.
* Although the other broad categorisation helps to ensure all forms of ideas and innovation can be submitted this category helps to reduce the risk of that even further. By stating any proposal idea is welcome we can further guarantee that funding is available for all forms of idea and innovation.

**Small maximum proposal budget**

* Applying a small maximum budget to proposals submitted in this category help ensure that a minimum amount of proposals will be funded. The use of a smaller cap means there will be a larger number funded.
* Increasing the number of proposals that are guaranteed to be funded will help reduce the competition between proposals as a larger number of them can be funded.
* The smaller proposal budget also is a form of a deterrent to better funded teams that are looking to request higher amounts.
* Increasing the number of funded proposals through the smaller budget also helps with increasing the number of ideas being tested in the community in parallel. This could help speed up shared learnings within the ecosystem.
* The other benefit of smaller budgets is this also means more teams will get funded. This helps to increase the diversity of people working in the ecosystem on different ideas and projects. Increasing diversity can also help to increase the rate of shared learning through different perspectives and experiences across the ecosystem.
