## Voting questions



### 1st Question - Budget weighting percentage for each category

****

**Question** - What percentage should be allocated to each of the funding categories?

****

**Important notes & rules**

* Only add whole numbers, no decimals or other characters
* The total for all categories MUST add up to exactly 100.
* Each category cannot have an allocation below 3%. This is to ensure every category has at least some funding as categories have been created to cover all forms of ideas and innovation.
* Voters can only vote once.
* Casted votes that do not follow the above guide will have ALL votes attached to that voter ID discarded.



**Answer options** - Attach a percentage weighting to the following categories. The total must add up to 100%, please check your math.

* **Community & Outreach**
* **Products & Integrations**
* **Governance & Identity**
* **Development & Infrastructure**
* **Nurturing Ideas & Teams**
* **Catalyst Contributors**
* **Cardano Contributors**

****

**Example**

If the total funding allocation was 16,000,000 ADA then if we apply following percentage examples to each category it would yield the following result:

| Category                     | Percentage | Category Budget Allocated |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------- |
| Community & Outreach         | 15         | 2,400,000 ADA             |
| Products & Integrations      | 20         | 3,200,000 ADA             |
| Governance & Identity        | 20         | 3,200,000 ADA             |
| Development & Infrastructure | 25         | 4,000,000 ADA             |
| Nurturing Ideas & Teams      | 6          | 960,000 ADA               |
| Catalyst Contributors        | 7          | 1,120,000 ADA             |
| Cardano Contributors         | 7          | 1,120,000 ADA             |

**NOTE**: The amounts in the above example would then need to be rounded to the closest 25,000 ADA. This is currently a required part of the funding process.



**Outcome notes**

* **Voter power** - 1 person 1 vote.
* **Weighted outcome** - The outcome from the vote is based on weightings. Values will be aggregated from every vote to work out the final value for each category.
* **Rounded outcome** - The final values will be rounded to the nearest whole number. For example, 24.64 would be rounded to a 25% allocation. The total weightings together will equal 100%.
