## Voting questions



### 1. Budget weighting percentage for each category

****

**Question** - What percentage should be allocated to each of the funding categories for the next funding round?

****

**Important notes & rules**

* Only add whole numbers, no decimals or other characters
* The total for all categories MUST add up to exactly 100.
* Each category cannot have an allocation below 3%. This is to ensure every category has at least some funding as categories have been created to cover all forms of ideas and innovation.
* Voters can only vote once.
* Casted votes that do not follow the above guide will have ALL votes attached to that voter ID discarded.



**Answer options** - Attach a percentage weighting to the following categories. The total must add up to 100%, please check your math.

* **Community & Outreach**
* **Products & Integrations**
* **Governance & Identity**
* **Development & Infrastructure**
* **Small & Early Stage Ideas**
* **Catalyst Contributors**
* **Infrastructure Contributors**

**Example**

The total funding amount for fund 9 is 12,800,000 ADA. Some example percentage values to consider:

**1% -** 128,000 ADA

**2% -** 256,000 ADA

**3%** - 384,000 ADA

**5% -** 640,000 ADA

**10% -** 1,280,000 ADA

Applying some percentages to each category that add up to 100% produces the following example:

| Category                     | Percentage | Category Budget Allocation |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------- |
| Community & Outreach         | 15         | 1,920,000 ADA              |
| Products & Integrations      | 20         | 2,560,000 ADA              |
| Governance & Identity        | 20         | 2,560,000 ADA              |
| Development & Infrastructure | 25         | 3,200,000 ADA              |
| Small & Early Stage Ideas    | 6          | 768,000 ADA                |
| Catalyst Contributors        | 7          | 896,000 ADA                |
| Infrastructure Contributors  | 7          | 896,000 ADA                |
| **Total**                    | **100**    | **12,800,000 ADA**         |

**NOTE**: The amounts in the example above would then need to be rounded to the closest 25,000 ADA. This is currently a required part of the funding process.



**Outcome notes**

* **Voter power** - 1 person 1 vote.
* **Weighted outcome** - The outcome from the vote is based on weightings. Values will be aggregated from every vote to work out the final value for each category.
* **Rounded outcome** - The final values will be rounded to the nearest whole number. For example, 24.64 would be rounded to a 25% allocation. The total weightings together will equal 100%.
