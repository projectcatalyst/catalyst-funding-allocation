## Voting decisions

The following is the two budget weighting decisions for this community vote.



### 1st Decision - Budget weighting percentage for each category

****

**Question** - What percentage should be allocated to each of the funding categories?

****

**Important notes & rules**

* The categories have been created to cover all forms of ideas and innovation.
* A minimum percentage of 4% is applied to each category so to ensure every category has some funding.
* If Nurturing Ideas & Teams is not voted in then the funds will be distributed proportionally to the other categories vote outcome based their weightings.

****

**Answer options** - Attach a percentage weighting to the following categories. The total must add up to 100%. Please check your math - misallocations below or above this will be discarded.

* **Community & Outreach**
* **Products & Integrations**
* **Governance & Identity**
* **Development & Infrastructure**
* **Nurturing Ideas & Teams**
* **Catalyst Contributors**
* **Cardano Contributors**

****

**Example**

If the total funding allocation was $16,000,000 then if we apply following percentage examples to each category it would yield the following result:

| Category                     | Percentage | Category Budget Allocated |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------- |
| Community & Outreach         | 15         | $2,400,000                |
| Products & Integrations      | 20         | $3,200,000                |
| Governance & Identity        | 20         | $3,200,000                |
| Development & Infrastructure | 25         | $4,000,000                |
| Nurturing Ideas & Teams      | 7          | $1,120,000                |
| Catalyst Contributors        | 7          | $1,120,000                |
| Cardano Contributors         | 6          | $960,000                  |

**NOTE**: The above example amounts would then need to be rounded to the closest $25,000 as this is required in the funding process.



**Outcome approach**

* **Voter power** - 1 person 1 vote.
* **Weighted outcome** - The outcome from the vote is based on weightings. The values will be aggregated from every vote to work out the final values for each category.
* **Rounded outcome** - The final values will be rounded to the nearest whole number. For example, 24.64 would be rounded to a 25% allocation. The total weightings together will equal 100%.
