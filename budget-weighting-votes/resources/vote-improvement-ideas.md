# Vote Improvement Ideas

We need a scalable, inclusive and democratic solution for budget weighting votes.

In the short and medium term ideas can be considered that would be an improvement over the manual approach of proof of life meetings along with an online form vote.

****

**Cardano metadata transaction vote**

ADA holders could send a transaction to themselves with the metadata that has their budget weighting vote preferences. The benefit of this is it makes it scalable to a large audience and can be inclusive to anyone with a range of wallets. Some problems with this approach is it would be plutocratic and give larger ADA holders more influence on the budget weighting. The current Catalyst voting approach is plutocratic so using this as a solution is arguably still not a regression.



**Testnet smart contract or transaction vote**

To remove the cost of the vote the testnet could be used to sign transactions. This approach couldn’t be plutocratic as it’s a testnet so for it to be democratic it would need some proof of life meeting or some form of KYC to make it democratic using a one person one vote model.



**Proof of life verifiable credential**

Use a community created Atala PRISM wallet to hold a proof of life credential to then use to sign a budget weighting vote. The benefit of this is it means message signing can be done from an identity wallet. The downsides to this approach is the infrastructure is still in its infancy so may be less accessible for many users and still would require a proof of life meeting and a set of issuers to distribute the credential.



**Discord user vote**

As an alternative to Google Forms for the voting stage a Discord plugin for votes could be potentially used.



**Cross chain solution**

Cross chain solutions could be used in the short term if a suitable solution existed. Upon further research no existing solution seemed to support budget weight votes with multiple entries.
