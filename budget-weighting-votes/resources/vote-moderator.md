# Vote Moderator

&#x20;**Vote moderator role**

The vote moderator role is responsible for helping to register community members so they are able to cast their budget weighting vote.



**Tasks & responsibilities**

* **Offer time availability** - Moderators will share with the community how and when they will be available to register community members for the vote.
* **Proof of life meetings** - For the community members the moderator registers they will have a short proof of life meeting to prove they are a human.
* **Verify full name** - The moderator will ask for the name of the community member to add to the voting register. Sufficient proof will be asked for to verify that name is accurate.
* **Record details** - To complete the registration the moderator will record the full name of the community member and assign them a ID ([UUID4](https://www.uuidtools.com/generate/v4)) number in a private spreadsheet.
* **Distribute ID number** - The moderator will give the community member their ID number which is what they will use when casting their budget weighting vote.

**Recommendations**

* **One to one meetings** - It is recommended for the moderators to host one to one meetings rather in any group setting to help prevent mistakes when recording registration details.

**Moderator selection process**

* Moderators selected should be trusted community members. For now this will mean the community member has an extended history and background in the ecosystem of ideally above one year. Alternatively they could also be a well known community member.
