# Budget Weighting Considerations

The following are some reasons for and against having a larger or smaller initial budget weightings for each of the [funding categories](../funding-categories/categories/) that have been suggested.&#x20;

The following are suggestions to consider when giving feedback on the budget weighting discussion or community surveys. These suggestions are completely up for debate and currently only help to provide a starting point for the discussion.&#x20;



**FEEDBACK AND THOUGHTS** - If you have some suggestions for other factors to consider for budget weighting please send them here and they can get added to the document: [https://t.me/catalystfundingcategories](https://t.me/catalystfundingcategories)



### Community & Outreach

**Reasons for a larger initial budget weighting**

* Need for community wide discussion around how ecosystem gets implemented and operates.
* A need for outreach to new collaborators or community members to help grow the number of people involved in the ecosystem.

**Reasons for a smaller initial budget weighting**

* It's beneficial to have products and integrations in place to form communities around to solve and iterate on defined problems and mission statements.
* Limited functionality and applications in the short term could cause increased churn for any outreach efforts to attract new community members.

### **Products & Integrations**

**Reasons for a larger initial budget weighting**

* Cardano needs more use cases through applications and integrations that will help drive adoption.

**Reasons for a smaller initial budget weighting**

* Developer ecosystem currently lacks a wide range of tools, libraries and SDKs. This makes it more difficult to develop applications on the Cardano ecosystem in the short term until more of the development ecosystem is implemented.



### Governance & Identity

**Reasons for a larger initial budget weighting**

* Catalyst is currently very centralised relying on IOG and Ideascale. More tools and processes that help the community can operate are needed to move more governance control over to the community.
* There is a lack of governance and identity tools and processes that can help applications building on Cardano to have more effective ways to govern their applications.

**Reasons for a smaller initial budget weighting**

* :thinking:



### Catalyst Contributors

**Reasons for a larger initial budget weighting**

* New tools and processes are needed to help the community take more ownership of the governance process.
* The Catalyst process is labour intensive and requires more people supporting how it operates.
* Contributors have an objective to help with collaboration which can help to reduce the amount of duplicated efforts for new developments that get funded in the Catalyst ecosystem.

**Reasons for a smaller initial  budget weighting**

* The contributor funding approach has not yet been tested in practice using a first round of contributors.



### Development & Node Operation

**Reasons for a larger initial budget weighting**

* New scripts, tools, libraries and SDKs are needed to make it easier to develop and deploy applications onto the Cardano blockchain.
* The developer ecosystem will become the backbone of what DApp developers use to build on top of the blockchain. Enough funding is required to pay for highly skilled developers that can produce secure and maintainable open source code that will be used by other teams to build applications.
