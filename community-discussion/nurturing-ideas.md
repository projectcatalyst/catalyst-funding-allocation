# Nurturing Ideas

### Broad categorisation problems

**Higher competition**

Smaller teams in the ecosystem may struggle to stand out in a more competitive set of broad categories.



**Less fair for people with fewer resources**

Broad categorisation is [egalitarian in theory](../analysis/egalitarian-funding-categorisation.md) but can be unfair for some proposers in practice that have [fewer resources](../analysis/proposers-with-fewer-resources.md). When competition is higher this can make it more difficult for people with fewer resources to compete with producing proposals as effectively as those with more resources.&#x20;

****

**Hidden new ideas**

If existing funded proposers are well known and have been effectively delivering against previous proposals then this could have a knock on impact for new proposal teams. New ideas from teams that aren't well known may struggle to get initial exposure and access to capital to prove their ideas are of importance.

## Nurturing Ideas



**Category Title**

Nurturing Ideas

**Category question**

How can we encourage smaller teams or new ideas to emerge and offer new approaches to evolve and support the Cardano ecosystem?

**Why is it important?**

Cardano needs an increasingly diverse amount of ideas and teams involved in trying out new things in the ecosystem.

**How does success look like?**

An increasing number of small initiatives and ideas that provide new opportunities to the ecosystem to learn or benefit from.

**Key Metrics to measure**

Please refer to the suggested challenge brief success metrics ideas for different proposal types.



### **Category brief**

**Overview**

Nurturing Ideas is focused on the following important areas:

* New and existing ideas that can benefit from a smaller budget to nurture their initial exploration and growth efforts.



**Why this category is important**

The ecosystem needs to have a way to easily introduce and nurture new and existing ideas that could provide impact to the ecosystem.

Having a category focussed on nurturing ideas can help to ensure that there is always an exploration of new ideas, processes and approaches within the ecosystem.&#x20;

Nurturing ideas provides an easier path to receiving funding in the the Catalyst ecosystem by having each proposal requesting a smaller amount of initial funding.

The more ideas and exploration the community can nurture the faster the ecosystem can learn from and develop better solutions.



**Types of proposals to include**

All idea for proposals are welcomed! To get some ideas you can refer to some of the other categories  that have been established.

****

**Potential success metrics for proposal types**

Proposers should clearly identify what problem they are trying to solve, how they are looking to start solving that and what outcomes they will expect from executing this proposal.&#x20;



**Proposal maximum budget**

The maximum proposal budget that can be requested is $40,000.&#x20;

****

**Considerations for proposers**

* **Open source plan** - There is no requirement that proposals that are producing software or assets would need to be open source. However the community benefits from knowing what plan proposers have, if any, to open source their work if this factor is relevant to the proposal.
