# Funding Categories Benefits

Funding categories are concerned with how Catalyst provides access to funding from the Cardano treasury to different areas in the Cardano ecosystem. A category groups proposals around a certain purpose or collection of topic areas.

The current [challenge setting process](../background/challenge-setting-approach.md) has a number of issues and complexities that can be avoided by using recurring, inclusive and broad categories rather than more changing, competitive and specific community chosen ones.

The following are the benefits for using recurring, inclusive and broad funding categories to allocate treasury funding.



### Recurring categorisation

Funding categories are recurring meaning they are used in every funding round. This has the following benefits:

* **Less budget weighting complexity** - Using similar categorisations in each funding round means in each round there is more data and insights in how the categorisation is used to make better informed decisions on the budget weightings of each of the categories.
* **Low categorisation justification** - Effort for categorisation is done upfront and then categories only get changed when necessary. Stakeholders such as proposers or assessors now don't need to propose and justify and then assess a new group of funding categorisations each and every funding round.
* **Low governance effort** - Using recurring categorisation means the community does not need to review and vote on which categorisation to include every funding round and instead can focus on improving the budget weighting for the categories.
* **Low stakeholder effort** - Recurring categorisation means the proposers and voters get the benefit of becoming more familiar with the categories over time saving them time and effort.



### Inclusive categorisation

Catalyst funding categories are inclusive meaning they should invite all forms of ideas and innovation to be submitted to the funding process. The benefits of inclusive categorisation include:

* **Open funding** - All forms of ideas and innovation can be submitted. This means maximising the amount of options the voter has to choose from when deciding where to allocate funding. Inclusive categorisation helps to ensure funding is more [egalitarian](../analysis/egalitarian-funding-categorisation.md).
* **No categorisation justification** - No effort is needed to justify the categorisation as the categories created cover all forms of ideas and innovation. This is in contrast to the challenge setting process which has significant effort required to justify why categorisations should or should not be included.
* **Easy to direct funding** - Inclusive categorisation with multiple categories still require budget weighting decisions to be made on how much to allocate to each category. This gives the community control over where to direct funding. On top of this there are multiple [approaches to direct funding](../analysis/approaches-for-directing-funding.md) that can also be explored.
* **Low governance effort** - Inclusive categorisation has low governance effort as categories don't need to be justified and voted on each round and instead only the budget weighting needs to be determined.
* **Drives healthy competition** - Ensuring that all ideas and innovation can be submitted in each funding round helps to increase the levels of competition between proposals. This gives the community more choice in deciding what they want to see get funding.
* **Maximises opportunity to find innovation** - The key issue with making a mandate on where to allocate funds is this does not reflect how innovation works. Putting a mandate that one specific area should receive funding over another does not mean that suitable innovation will turn up in that challenge nor does it mean the proposal team is well suited for its execution. There is also no guarantee of what innovation could emerge from areas that have been rejected for a given funding round which presents potential delayed or missed opportunities. Strong ideas and innovation could come at anytime. By using inclusive categories that allow any idea to be submitted the ecosystem maximises the opportunity for new innovation to emerge. Voters are always able to pick which proposals they want to receive funding meaning the process is fair and completely community led.



### Broad categorisation

Broad categorisation means that a larger number of different types of ideas and innovation are submitted under each category rather than having a higher number of more specific categories. The advantage of broader categorisation include:

* **Low budget weighting complexity** - Usage of fewer categories means having a lower complexity for determining what amount of funding should be allocated to each category. Fewer categorisations lower the probability that in a given round that one categorisation is too restrictive or excessive in access to funding as broad categorisation is more flexible by being able to accept multiple proposal types.
* **Low governance effort** - Governance efforts only need to focus on the budget weighting between a small number of categories meaning less precision is needed than having a higher amount of specific categories.
* **Low stakeholder effort** - Stakeholders that bring together information to help with budget weighting decisions would not need to go into as much depth with broader categorisation. The smaller the number of categorisations the less complex the decisions become around budget weighting.
* **Promotes healthy competition** - Having a smaller amount of broad categories helps ensure there is always a certain level of healthy competition in each category. This helps preventing being too specific on categorisation that can lead to less popular areas not getting enough competition between proposals and for areas that are overly popular not being able to expand if the quality of ideas and innovation submitted is very high. To support new ideas and innovation or unknown teams a category has also been considered to help from limiting competition using a maximum proposal budget size as covered in the [nurturing ideas & teams](../funding-categories/nurturing-ideas-and-teams.md) category.&#x20;

### **Challenge setting benefits and issues**&#x20;

**Benefits not lost through using Catalyst categories**

* **Ability to direct funding** - Using recurring, inclusive and broad categorisation doesn't impact the communities overall ability to direct funding. The most important thing the community always has is their vote. As well as that there are multiple [approaches to direct funding](../analysis/approaches-for-directing-funding.md).
* **Idea generation** - The community is able to create reports and voting systems to help with creating different ideas across the community. [Idea generation](concerns-and-solutions/proposal-idea-generation.md) does not need to be attached to funding categorisation as we discuss in the [concerns and solutions](concerns-and-solutions/proposal-idea-generation.md).
* **Verifiability** - Categories can still easily verify the impact of the proposals funded in that categorisation. Specific metrics don't need to be attached to specific categorisation. Specific metrics can easily be applied to any proposal regardless of the funding categorisation used. This is discussed in the [concerns and solutions for verifiability](concerns-and-solutions/verifiability.md).



**Removal of issues faced by challenge settings**&#x20;

There are a number of issues with the current challenge setting process that get removed by using catalyst categories which are recurring, inclusive and broad. Removing these issues can be achieved in a number of ways however achieving this with Catalyst funding categories is another reason to consider fully adopting this approach to categorisation.

* **Preventing duplicate challenge settings -** Not creating multiple challenge settings every funding round removes the issues around duplicated challenge settings that currently cause an issue of funding easily being over or under allocated to certain areas.
* **Removes challenges created by self interest -** Using an inclusive smaller number of categories means that challenges can't be created out of self interest to direct more funding to one group over another.
* **Reduces need for challenge team knowledge and deeper ecosystem understanding -** Using recurring and broad categories means the community doesn't need to have the same depth of understanding about the ecosystem to make well informed decisions on suitable budget weightings for each category. The more categories you introduce or the more often you change them the more complex it becomes to make well informed decisions on the budget weighting to use.
* **Removes easy entry for malicious actors -** Using recurring categories over changing community created ones each funding round removes the possibility for malicious actors to try and game or break the funding allocation system by writing and promoting challenges that aren't in the best interests of the wider community.



### Catalyst stakeholder benefits

Usage of funding categories has a number of benefits for different stakeholders in Catalyst.



**Reduced proposer effort**

* Proposers would not need to draft up challenge setting proposals every funding round and determine a budget allocation.
* Proposers would not need to spend time learning new categorisations and where they can submit their proposals each funding round. Proposers can more accurately detail what they plan to do exactly rather than trying to fit their proposal into a more restrictive challenge.



**Reduced voter effort**

* Voters only need to understand a smaller number of categories to know where to look for certain proposal types to vote on. Voters will have more time to spend on reading proposals than understanding the categorisations.
* Voters don't need to understand a wide number of changing categories to make decisions on which categorisations to include or exclude every funding round and instead can only need to help with voting on the budget weightings between the recurring categories.



**Reduced community advisor effort**

* Community advisors would not need to understand the unique assessment criteria around using challenge settings.&#x20;
* Community advisors would not need to read, understand and assess a large number of challenge settings meaning those resources and efforts can be spent improving the assessments made on proposals.
* Veteran community advisors would not need to review the assessments on challenge settings meaning those resources and effort can be spent improving the reviews of assessments on proposals.



### **Summary**

* **Reduced complexity -** Funding categorisation does not need to be complex. Making funding categorisation complex, as it is in its current form, yields little benefit when compared to other approaches such as using recurring, inclusive and broad categorisation.
* **Significantly less stakeholder and governance effort** - The usage of recurring, inclusive and broad categorisation significantly reduces the resources required to manage the Catalyst process and even lead to giving more control to the voters on where to direct funding.&#x20;
* **No loss of existing challenge setting benefits** - All of the benefits that are present with the existing process are maintained when using recurring, inclusive and broad categorisation. The suggested categories come with a significant benefit of helping to more effectively reallocate a large amount resources and effort.
* **More resources for complex problems** - By adopting funding categories the community can spend more time and resources on the areas in the Catalyst ecosystem that the community must truly master to become a globally scaleable funding system. Examples of this include how to handle a growing number of complex proposals. Another is being able to handle increasingly sophisticated malicious actors that use complex sybil attacks, scams or fraud to try and extract funding from the treasury.
