description: A list of suggested categories to use for allocating Catalyst funding
---

# Categories

The following are the suggested high level categories that provide a simpler way to do [funding allocation](../analysis/funding-allocation-approaches.md). The categories below are inclusive in that they should allow for any type of idea or innovation to be included in any given funding round.



**Outreach & Engagement**

For proposals that help with outreach and engagement for both people outside the community and existing community members. Proposals that fit into this category:

* **Online & in person events** - Any Cardano related event that helps bring new or existing community members together around a given topic or cause.
* **Hackathons** - Encouraging new projects and teams to form around a development theme
* **Public outreach** - Using any marketing approaches to help drive further adoption to the ecosystem.
* **Government outreach & engagement** - Outreach and meetings with government officials that help to drive awareness and policy improvements.
* **Demos** - Demo tutorials and videos of ecosystem functionality or DApp features that helps newcomers learn about Cardano and the wider ecosystem.
* **Interviews & podcasts** - Recorded interview and podcasts with community members and project teams to showcase news and latest developments.
* **Community hubs** - Education, awareness and support based community hubs in different countries internationally.
* **Proposer outreach** - Outreach approaches to help increase the number of quality proposals submitted into each funding round.
* **Translation support** - Support for translating core resources both in the ecosystem or for DApp projects that would help to engage more of the international community.



**Catalyst Ecosystem**&#x20;

The Catalyst ecosystem category looks for proposals that will help with improving and maintaining the Catalyst governance ecosystem for managing the Cardano treasury.

* **Governance tools, libraries & SDKs** - Tools that help with governance participation and decision making that can be used by Catalyst but also could be used by other teams building in the ecosystem. Tools for governance will help the Catalyst function more effectively as a DAO.
* **Identity tools, libraries & SDKs** - Identity tools that help with Catalyst governance or that could be used by the wider community.
* **Auditing tools or processes** - Tools and process improvements that help with auditing funded proposals to help ensure they have the support needed to maximise the impact produced.
* **Catalyst accelerators & mentors** - Tools, guides, mentors and programs that help people with going through the Catalyst funding process and working on their project.&#x20;
* **Resources, processes & documentation** - Improvements to resources, processes and documentation that help with understanding and engaging with the Catalyst ecosystem.
* **Governance research and analysis** - Research and analysis projects that will help improve how the community can approach governance.

**Cardano Ecosystem**

The Cardano ecosystem category looks for proposals that will help improve and maintain the Cardano blockchain and supporting infrastructure that help with areas such as making it easier to build on, making it scaleable or helping improve decentralization. Proposals that fit into this category include:

* **DAO tools, libraries & SDKs** - Development that helps the wider community to build DAOs for their own projects.
* **SPO tools, scripts, libraries & SDKs** - Development that helps the SPO community more easily start and run their Cardano nodes or other ecosystem node infrastructure.
* **Plutus and IELE tools, libraries & SDKs** - Development that helps DApp developers more easily write and deploy smart contracts onto the Cardano blockchain.
* **Native asset tools, libraries & SDKs** - Development to improve how the community and DApp developers issue and manage native assets.&#x20;
* **Resources & documentation** - Technical documentation on how to use different tools, libraries or SDKs in the ecosystem.&#x20;
* **Standards** - Creation and improvement of standards used within the ecosystem that help to improve the overall quality of software deployed.
* **Research and development** - Research and development on new novel approaches that could be used in the Cardano ecosystem. This could include areas such as security, scalability or interoperability.

&#x20;

**DApps and Integrations**

The DApps and integrations category looks for proposals for any project looking to build on top of Cardano. Proposals that fit into this category include:

* **DeFi** - Stable coins, DEXs, borrow & lending, synthetic assets, others...
* **Gaming** - Open world games, card games, RPG, others...
* **Nation governance systems** - New governance systems for nation states
* **Environment** - DApps that help to solve environment issues
* **Transport & logistics**
* **Social media**
* **Marketplaces**
* **Many others** - Any other idea that someone thinks should be introduced to the ecosystem!



**Catalyst Contributors**

[Catalyst contributors](https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-contributors/) are a category for people to apply to work full time in the Catalyst ecosystem to support and improve the governance tools and processes being used. Proposals in this category are potential candidates who would like to be paid to support a specific focus area.



**Cardano Contributors**

[Cardano contributors](https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/cardano-contributors/) are a category for people to apply to work full time in supporting the Cardano ecosystem. This includes both stake pool operators who help to ensure the chain is operational and also the development of tools, libraries and SDKs that the wider community will use to build on top of Cardano.



**Catalyst Natives**

Other ecosystem projects can introduce their own funding challenge into the process with their own self determined funding allocation amounts for rewarding proposals.
