# Categories

The following are the suggested broad categories that provide a simpler way to do [funding allocation](../../analysis/funding-categorisation-specificity.md). The categories below are inclusive in that they should allow for any type of idea or innovation to be included in any given funding round.

**Catalyst Ecosystem**&#x20;

The Catalyst ecosystem category focusses on proposals that will help with improve and support the Catalyst ecosystem that managed the Cardano treasury. It also aims to help with providing wider ecosystem support with tools, libraries and SDKs concerning governance and identity.

**Catalyst Contributors**

[Catalyst contributors](https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-contributors/) are a category for people to apply to work full time in the Catalyst ecosystem to support and improve the governance tools and processes used in Catalyst and the wider ecosystem. Proposals in this category are from candidates who would like to be paid to fulfil a certain role.

**Cardano Ecosystem**&#x20;

The Cardano ecosystem category looks for proposals that will help improve and maintain the Cardano developer ecosystem with tools, scripts, libraries and SDKs that would make it easier for developers to build new applications. It also looks at supporting the stake pool operation with tools and resources to make it as easy as possible for people to help secure the network by running a stake pool node.

**Cardano Contributors**

[Cardano contributors](https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/cardano-contributors/) are a category for people to apply to work full time in the Cardano ecosystem. This includes those who want to help support improving the stake pool ecosystem and the Cardano developer ecosystem. Contributors would help analyse, coordinate or develop tools, libraries and SDKs for the ecosystem to use. Proposals in this category are from candidates who would like to be paid to fulfil a certain role.

**Catalyst Natives**

Other ecosystem projects can introduce their own funding challenges into the process with their own self determined funding allocation amounts for rewarding proposals.
