# Cardano Ecosystem

**Category Title**

Cardano Ecosystem

**Category question**

What new resources, tools, libraries, SDKs, scripts or research can help those trying to run a node to secure the Cardano network or those building out the developer ecosystem?&#x20;

**Why is it important?**

The Cardano ecosystem needs to be easy and efficient for new operators to run nodes to secure the network and for new developers to build applications and integrations.

**How does success look like?**

New or improvements of resources, tools, libraries, SDKs, scripts or research that improve the Cardano developer ecosystem or the operation of stake pool nodes.

**Key Metrics to measure**

Please refer to the suggested challenge brief success metrics ideas for different proposal types.



### **Category brief**

**Overview**

Cardano Ecosystem is focused on the following areas:

* Creation and improvement of tools, scripts, libraries and SDKs that help make it easier for projects to develop on Cardano and for the community to operate nodes in the network.
* Research, analysis and creation of standards, resources or documentation that bring either novel innovation to the ecosystem or help with improving the education of the existing ecosystem.

****

**Why this category is important**

The Cardano developer ecosystem and operation of stake pool nodes need to be easy for newcomers and budding talent to get involved with and learn.

To make it easy to develop projects on Cardano as well as operate the network there is a need for high quality resources, standards, tools, scripts, libraries and SDKs for developers and operators to use.

The higher quality and more thorough the developer and stake pool node ecosystem is for Cardano the faster that people can be onboarded and build out applications that the high quality and security standards that ecosystem needs to thrive.



**Types of proposals to include**

* **SPO tools, scripts, libraries & SDKs** - Development that helps the SPO community more easily start and run their Cardano nodes or other ecosystem node infrastructure.
* **Plutus and IELE tools, libraries & SDKs** - Development that helps developers more easily write and deploy smart contracts onto the Cardano blockchain.
* **Native asset tools, libraries & SDKs** - Development to improve how the community and developers can issue and manage native assets.&#x20;
* **Scalability solutions** - Rollups (e.g. zero knowledge rollups, optimistic rollups), sharding, state channels, zero knowledge proofs, side chains.
* **Resources & documentation** - Technical documentation on how to use different tools, libraries or SDKs in the ecosystem.&#x20;
* **Standards** - Creation and improvement of standards used within the ecosystem that help to improve the overall quality of software deployed.
* **Research and development** - Research and development on new novel approaches that could be used in the Cardano ecosystem. This could include areas such as security, scalability or interoperability.

****

**Potential success metrics for proposal types**

* **SPO tools, scripts, libraries & SDKs** - Amount of adoption from other projects, metrics around any scalability, security or cost improvements.
* **Plutus and IELE tools, libraries & SDKs** - Amount of adoption from other projects, metrics around any scalability, security or cost improvements.
* **Native asset tools, libraries & SDKs** - Amount of adoption from other projects, metrics around any scalability, security or cost improvements.
* **Scalability solutions** - Total transactions per second achievable, increases in transaction efficiency achieved, security guarantees achieved.
* **Resources & documentation** - Amount of people viewing resources, reduction in number of common questions to contributors due to better resources
* **Standards** - Increase in any security thresholds for new applications, Increases in performance achievable by applications
* **Research and development** - Number of projects utilising new novel approaches to development or node operation, number of new standards created due to research efforts



**Considerations for proposers**

* **Open source plan** - Any tools, libraries or SDKs are encouraged to be open source either from the start or as soon as possible. There is no requirement to be open source immediately however proposers should include the details of their plan towards open sourcing the project.
* **Commercial projects** - Development projects most suited here will be open source with the aim of the work executed being available for the benefit of other projects to use and build their applications with. Commercial projects looking to build a network or DApp suited for the  end user should use the Products & Integrations category for proposals. Projects are welcomed to make proposals in this category for any specific parts of their project that would be open source and should have benefit to the wider ecosystem around improving the development ecosystem or operation of Cardano.
