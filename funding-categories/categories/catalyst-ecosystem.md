# Catalyst Ecosystem

**Category Title**

Catalyst Ecosystem

**Category question**

What new tools, processes or research can help improve the governance of the Cardano treasury?

**Why is it important?**

The Cardano ecosystem needs effective governance of the treasury so that funding can be distributed to areas that produce the most impact.

**How does success look like?**

Continuous improvement and evolution of the governance ecosystem and processes that most effectively support the Cardano ecosystem.

**Key Metrics to measure**

Please refer to the suggested challenge brief success metric.



### **Category brief**

**Overview**

Catalyst Ecosystem is focussed on the following areas:

* Tools, libraries and SDKs that help with improving governance and identity around the systems we use including Catalyst and for the wider ecosystem applications.&#x20;
* Resources, processes, documentation, mentors and accelerators that make it easier to participate and engage in the governance process in Catalyst.
* Research and analysis that help drive novel or improved approaches for governance that can be used in the Catalyst and wider ecosystem.

****

**Why this category is important**

Catalyst provides the governance process for the distribution of Cardano treasury funding.&#x20;

To maximise the potential of the ecosystem there is a need for effective and robust governance to help distribute treasury funding that will create a thriving community, development ecosystem and growing list of DApps and integrations.

The better that Catalyst is able to effectively help with governing and distributing funds the faster the ecosystem can create the innovations and adoption needed for Cardano to thrive as a ecosystem.



**Types of proposals to include**

* **Governance tools, libraries & SDKs** - Tools that help with governance participation and decision making that can be used by Catalyst but also could be used by other teams building in the ecosystem. Tools for governance will help the Catalyst function more effectively as a DAO.
* **DAO tools, libraries & SDKs** - Development that helps the wider community to build DAOs for their own projects.
* **Identity tools, libraries & SDKs** - Identity tools that help with Catalyst governance or that could be used by the wider community.
* **Auditing tools or processes** - Tools and process improvements that help with auditing funded proposals to help ensure they have the support needed to maximise the impact produced.
* **Catalyst accelerators & mentors** - Tools, guides, mentors and programs that help people with going through the Catalyst funding process and working on their project.&#x20;
* **Resources, processes & documentation** - Improvements to resources, processes and documentation that help with understanding and engaging with the Catalyst ecosystem.
* **Governance research and analysis** - Research and analysis projects that will help improve how the community can approach governance.

**Potential success metrics for proposal types**

This list is not exhaustive but does provides some ideas for proposers to consider.

* **Governance tools, libraries & SDKs** - Amount of adoption from other projects, improvement metrics from any adoption in Catalyst ecosystem.
* **DAO tools, libraries & SDKs** - Amount of adoption from other projects, improvement metrics from any adoption in Catalyst ecosystem.
* **Identity tools, libraries & SDKs** - Amount of adoption from other projects, improvement metrics from any adoption in Catalyst ecosystem.
* **Auditing tools or processes** - Amount of adoption from other projects, number of projects being audited, number of projects receiving extra support, number of projects having funding halted due to lack of execution.
* **Catalyst accelerators & mentors** - Number of projects onboarded onto support programs, number of projects supported&#x20;
* **Resources, processes & documentation** - Number of viewers on content, reduction in common questions support due to better resources or documentation
* **Governance research and analysis** - Number of citations, number of projects utilising research or analysis in their execution



**Considerations for proposers**

* **Open source plan** - Any tools, libraries or SDKs are encouraged to be open source either from the start or as soon as possible. There is no requirement to be open source immediately however proposers should include the details of their plan towards open sourcing the project.
* **Commercial projects** - Development projects most suited here will be open source with the aim of the work executed being available for the benefit of other projects to use and build their applications with. Commercial projects looking to build a network or DApp suited for an end user should use the DApps & Integration category for proposals. Projects are welcomed to make proposals in this category for any specific parts of their project that would be open source and should have benefit to the wider ecosystem for helping with governance or identity.
