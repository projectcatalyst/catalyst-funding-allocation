# Community & Outreach

**Category Title**

Community & Outreach

**Category question**

How can we engage the community and also do outreach that brings more people into the ecosystem and also helps with collaborating with external people and organisations.

**Why is it important?**

Cardano needs an engaged and thriving community along with collaboration with those outside the community so that the ecosystem is welcoming, collaborative and engaging.

**How does success look like?**

Communities forming around certain topics, public goods or ecosystem areas and approaches that promote collaboration and helping to introduce more people into the community.

**Key Metrics to measure**

Please refer to the suggested challenge brief success metrics ideas for different proposal types.



### **Category brief**

**Overview**

Community & Outreach is focused on the following important areas:

* Bringing the community together to engage with one another over important problems, topics, causes and any other important conversations.
* Talking to people and organisations outside the community looking at how together we can help to solve problems, explore ways to collaborate or consider different opportunities for innovation.
* Finding people outside the community interested in learning more about the ecosystem or joining a community that they could be passionate about.

****

**Why this category is important**

The community for any decentralized ecosystem is what makes that ecosystem truly valuable.

Supporting initiatives that help bring the community together or better collaborate with people outside the community will increase the rate we as a community can learn about different people, communities and problems.

The better that communities form around common goals and missions the easier it will be to find potential new solutions or collaborations that improve both the ecosystem and the world around us.

Effective community initiatives will improve how people joining the ecosystem find the missions that they are most passionate about and causes that they truly resonate with.



**Types of proposals to include**

* **Online & in person events** - Any Cardano related event that helps bring new or existing community members together around a given topic or cause.
* **Hackathons** - Encouraging new projects and teams to form around a development theme
* **Public outreach** - Proposals for any marketing approaches that can help drive further adoption of the ecosystem.
* **Government outreach & engagement** - Outreach and meetings with government officials that help to drive awareness and policy improvements.

* **Interviews & podcasts** - Recorded interview and podcasts with community members and project teams to showcase news and latest developments.
* **Community hubs** - Education, awareness and support based community hubs in different countries internationally.

* **Translation support** - Support for translating core resources both in the ecosystem or for DApp projects that would help to engage more of the international community.
