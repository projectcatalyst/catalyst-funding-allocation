# DApps & Integrations

**Category Title**

DApps & Integrations

**Category question**

What new DApps and integrations can be developed that will offer more use cases to the Cardano ecosystem that are high impact and drive more adoption?&#x20;

**Why is it important?**

Cardano needs new innovations and applications for the ecosystem to reach its full potential and improve the systems that society relies on across the world.

**How does success look like?**

An increasing number of DApps or integrations that offer new solutions for people to interact and benefit from the Cardano ecosystem.

**Key Metrics to measure**

Please refer to the suggested challenge brief success metric.



### **Category brief**

**Overview**

DApps & Integrations is focussed on the following areas:

* Creation of new DApps or improvements to existing DApps that provide value to the Cardano community and wider ecosystem.&#x20;
* Integrations with other existing services and protocols that make it easier to use and benefit from the use of the Cardano ecosystem.&#x20;

****

**Why this category is important**

Cardano needs a thriving ecosystem of different applications and integrations for the community to use that increasingly become the better alternatives than current centralised services.

The more interesting and useful applications and integration that can be built in the ecosystem the more reasons people have to interact with the Cardano blockchain which will further drive more adoption, feedback and growth.



**Types of proposals to include**

* **DeFi** - Stable coins, DEXs, borrow & lending, synthetic assets, others...
* **Gaming** - Open world games, card games, RPG, others...
* **Nation governance systems** - New governance systems for nation states
* **Environment** - DApps that help to solve environment issues
* **Transport & logistics**
* **Social media**
* **Marketplaces**
* **Many others** - Any other idea that someone thinks can be built on the Cardano blockchain and should be introduced to the ecosystem!

****

**Potential success metrics for proposal types**

This list is not exhaustive but does provides some ideas for proposers to consider.

* **DeFi** - Total value locked, total number of users, number of active daily / weekly / monthly users
* **Gaming** - Number of players, player income generated (if play to earn), qualitative feedback on game experience
* **Nation governance systems** - Amount of population onboarded, amount of costs saved due to new solution, security difficulty improvements over previous approach
* **Environment** - Total number of users, total CO2 sequestered, amount of awareness being produced, number of people changing a environmentally damaging habit&#x20;
* **Transport & logistics** - Total number of packages tracked, Number of counterfeit items prevented&#x20;
* **Social media** - Total number of users, number of meaningful interactions
* **Marketplaces** - Total number of users, number of transactions performed
* **Many others** - Proposers can add in whatever metrics or success criteria make sense for their own project!



**Considerations for proposers**

* **Existing applications or integrations** - What applications or integrations already exist in the ecosystem? What are the core differences between the proposal being presented and those existing ones and why will that provide impact to the ecosystem?
* **Technical requirements** - Does the Cardano ecosystem have the right tools, libraries and SDKs for the idea to be feasible? What needs to be introduced or improved for the proposal to fully reach its potential?
* **Ecosystem maturity requirements** - Why is this application or integration suitable for execution right now? Are there enough pieces of infrastructure, applications or other integrations available that would be needed for this suggested proposal to have a strong chance of gaining adoption? For instance, if you were making a professional social network DApp, do the right identity tools and wallets exist to make a professional network feasible?
