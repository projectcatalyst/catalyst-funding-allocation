# Governance & Identity

**Category Title**

Governance & Identity

**Category question**

What tools, processes and research will improve governance or identity in the Catalyst ecosystem or for applications building on Cardano?

**Why is it important?**

There is a need for effective governance and identity tools to support making it easier for application development and evolution of Catalyst

**How does success look like?**

Evolution of the governance and identity ecosystem tools, processes and resources to improve Catalyst and applications building on Cardano

**Key Metrics to measure**

Please refer to the suggested challenge brief success metrics ideas for different proposal types.



### **Category brief**

**Overview**

Governance & Identity is focused on the following areas:

* Tools, libraries and SDKs that help with improving governance and identity around the systems we use including Catalyst or also to be used by wider ecosystem applications.&#x20;
* Resources, processes, documentation, mentors and accelerators that make it easier to participate and engage in the Catalyst governance process.
* Research, analysis or reports that help drive novel or improved approaches for governance or identity that can be used in the Catalyst or wider ecosystem.

****

**Why this category is important**

Catalyst provides the governance process for the distribution of Cardano treasury funding.&#x20;

To maximise the potential of the ecosystem there is a need for effective and robust governance and identity tools to help distribute treasury funding. Achieving this will create a thriving community, an easier to use development ecosystem and nurture a growing list of products and integrations.

The better that Catalyst is able to effectively help with governing and distributing funds the faster the ecosystem can create the innovations and adoption needed for Cardano to thrive. The better open source tools are made available for governance and identity within the ecosystem the faster interesting and novel solutions can be deployed.



**Types of proposals to include**

* **Governance tools, libraries & SDKs** - Tools that help with governance participation and decision making that can be used by Catalyst but also could be used by other teams building in the ecosystem. Tools for governance will help the Catalyst function more effectively as a DAO.
* **DAO tools, libraries & SDKs** - Development that helps the wider community to build DAOs for their own projects.
* **Identity tools, libraries & SDKs** - Identity tools that help with Catalyst governance or that could be used in other applications in the wider ecosystem. Identity solutions could be Atala PRISM focussed but could also be integrations of other identity systems into the Cardano ecosystem.
* **Rapid funding mechanisms** - New rapid funding mechanisms looking at improving the distribution of funding of the Cardano treasury.
* **Auditing tools or processes** - Tools and process improvements that help with auditing funded proposals to help ensure they have the support needed to maximise the impact produced.
* **Catalyst accelerators & mentors** - Tools, guides, mentors and programs that help people with going through the Catalyst funding process and working on their project.&#x20;
* **Resources, processes, hosted discussions & documentation** - Proposals aimed at helping improve understanding and engagement with the Catalyst ecosystem or around governance topics such as improving decision making or processes for how the community reaches consensus.
* **Governance research and analysis** - Research and analysis projects that will help improve how the community can approach governance. This can include exploring existing or new governance models that could improve how the community approaches distributed governance.
* **Education** - Demos, guides, videos or documentation for improving the education resources available about the different governance and identity tools, libraries and processes available in the ecosystem.

**Potential success metrics for proposal types**

This list is not exhaustive but does provides some ideas for proposers to consider.

* **Governance tools, libraries & SDKs** - Amount of adoption from other projects, improvement metrics from any adoption in Catalyst ecosystem.
* **DAO tools, libraries & SDKs** - Amount of adoption from other projects, improvement metrics from any adoption in Catalyst ecosystem.
* **Identity tools, libraries & SDKs** - Amount of adoption from other projects, improvement metrics from any adoption in Catalyst ecosystem.
* **Rapid funding mechanisms** - Number of participants involved in governance process, speed of funding distribution, number of projects supported through mechanism.
* **Auditing tools or processes** - Amount of adoption from other projects, number of projects being audited, number of projects receiving extra support, number of projects having funding halted due to lack of execution.
* **Catalyst accelerators & mentors** - Number of projects onboarded onto support programs, number of projects supported.
* **Resources, processes, hosted discussions & documentation** - Number of viewers on content, reduction in common questions support due to better resources or documentation.
* **Governance research and analysis** - Number of citations, number of projects utilising research or analysis in their execution.
* **Education -** Number of viewers or participants of education resource, testimonies on the quality of the resources made from community feedback.



**Considerations for proposers**

* **Open source plan** - Any tools, libraries or SDKs are encouraged to be open source either from the start or as soon as possible. There is no requirement to be open source immediately however proposers should include the details of their plan towards open sourcing the project.
* **Commercial projects** - Development projects most suited here will be open source with the aim of the work executed being available for the benefit of other projects to use and build their applications with. Commercial projects looking to build a network or DApp suited for an end user should use the DApps & Integration category for proposals. Projects are welcomed to make proposals in this category for any specific parts of their project that would be open source and should have benefit to the wider ecosystem for helping with governance or identity.
