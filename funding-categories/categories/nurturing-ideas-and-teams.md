# Nurturing Ideas & Teams

**Category Title**

Nurturing Ideas & Teams

**Category question**

How can we encourage new ideas and teams to form and bring new innovations or support to the ecosystem?

**Why is it important?**

Ecosystems needs an increasingly diverse group of teams trying different ideas to explore how to innovate and support the ecosystem

**How does success look like?**

An increasing number of small initiatives and ideas that provide new opportunities to the ecosystem to learn and benefit from

**Key Metrics to measure**

The community will benefit from measuring:

* The number of new teams funded to support the ecosystem or offer new novel innovations.
* The number of new and novel ideas that help the ecosystem learn about which ideas should receive more attention and funding in future.
* How those funded for this category lead to education or further proposals that improve the ecosystem.



### **Category brief**

**Overview**

Nurturing Ideas is focused on the following important areas:

* New and existing ideas that can benefit from a smaller budget to nurture their initial exploration and growth efforts.
* Support of new teams joining the ecosystem looking for some initial capital to start off their project.&#x20;



**Why this category is important**

The ecosystem needs to have a way to easily introduce and nurture new and existing ideas that could provide impact to the ecosystem.

Having a category focussed on nurturing ideas can help to ensure that there is always exploration of new ideas, processes and approaches that could benefit the ecosystem.&#x20;

Nurturing ideas & teams is a category that applies a cap to the amount of funding a proposal can request. This provides a less competitive environment for teams to find initial funding to nurture their growth and evolution.

This category can be seen as an on ramp for new ideas and teams for trying things out something and showing the community what they are capable of achieving.

The more ideas and exploration the community can nurture the faster the ecosystem can learn from and develop better solutions. The more new teams that can be formed the better the diversity and combined efforts that can be made as a community.



**Types of proposals to include**

All proposal ideas are welcomed! Proposals must be related to the Cardano ecosystem whether that's a new idea, community initiative, marketing, development, support or any other type of proposal. To get some ideas you can refer to the other Catalyst funding categories!

**Potential success metrics for proposal types**

Proposers should clearly identify what problem they are trying to solve, how they aim to solve that problem and share the types of outcomes the community should expect after the proposal is executed.



**Proposal maximum budget**

The maximum proposal budget that can be requested is $40,000.&#x20;

**Considerations for proposers**

* **Existing initiatives and projects** - Proposers are encouraged to share in their proposal if there are similar proposals looking to achieve what they are requesting funding for. Share any information on collaborations with the community so voters are able to see your involvement in the community.
* **Open source plan** - There is no requirement that proposals that are producing software or digital assets need to be open source. However the community benefits from knowing what plan the proposers have, if any, to open source their work.&#x20;
