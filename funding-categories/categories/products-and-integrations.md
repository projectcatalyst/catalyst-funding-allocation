# Products & Integrations

**Category Title**

Products & Integrations

**Category question**

What new products and integrations can be developed that will offer more use cases to the Cardano ecosystem that are high impact and drive more adoption?&#x20;

**Why is it important?**

Cardano needs new innovations and solutions for the ecosystem to reach its full potential and improve the systems that society relies on across the world.

**How does success look like?**

An increasing number of products or integrations that offer new solutions for people to interact with and benefit from when using Cardano.

**Key Metrics to measure**

Please refer to the suggested challenge brief success metrics ideas for different proposal types.



### **Category brief**

**Overview**

Products & Integrations is focused on the following areas:

* Creation or improvement of different products that provide value to the Cardano community and wider ecosystem.
* Integrations with other existing services, products and protocols that improve the end user experience whether thats giving the user more options or making something easier to use that benefits the wider ecosystem.&#x20;

****

**Why this category is important**

Cardano needs a thriving ecosystem of different products and integrations for the community to use that increasingly become the better alternatives over current centralised providers.

The more interesting and useful the products and integrations are that can be built in the ecosystem the more reasons people have to interact with the Cardano blockchain that can help further drive more adoption, feedback, growth and even more innovations.



**Types of proposals to include**

* **Hardware** - Hardware wallets, Local ATMs for interacting with the blockchain, others...
* **Physical products** - Tokenised housing as a Cardano native asset, International crypto headquarters and liason office on every continent, others...
* **DeFi** - Stable coins, DEXs, borrow & lending, synthetic assets, others...
* **Gaming** - Open world games, card games, RPG, others...
* **Nation governance systems** - New governance systems for nation states
* **Environment** - Solutions that help to solve environment issues
* **Transport & logistics**
* **Social media**
* **Marketplaces**
* **Many others** - Any other idea, product or integration that someone thinks should be built in the Cardano ecosystem!

****

**Potential success metrics for proposal types**

This list is not exhaustive but does provides some ideas for proposers to consider.

* **Hardware** - Number of items sold, number of total users, number of interactions with hardware solution
* **Physical products** - Number of products tokenised as a native asset, Number of people using physical solution
* **DeFi** - Total value locked, total number of users, number of active daily / weekly / monthly users
* **Gaming** - Number of players, player income generated (if play to earn), qualitative feedback on game experience
* **Nation governance systems** - Amount of population onboarded, amount of costs saved due to new solution, security difficulty improvements over previous approach
* **Environment** - Total number of users, total CO2 sequestered, amount of awareness being produced, number of people changing a environmentally damaging habit&#x20;
* **Transport & logistics** - Total number of packages tracked, Number of counterfeit items prevented&#x20;
* **Social media** - Total number of users, number of meaningful interactions
* **Marketplaces** - Total number of users, number of transactions performed
* **Many others** - Proposers can add in whatever metrics or success criteria make sense for their own project!



**Considerations for proposers**

* **Existing products or integrations** - What products or integrations already exist in the ecosystem? What are the core differences between the proposal being presented and those existing ones and why will that provide impact to the ecosystem?
* **Technical requirements** - Does the Cardano ecosystem have the right tools, libraries and SDKs for the idea to be feasible? What needs to be introduced or improved for the proposal to fully reach its potential?
* **Ecosystem maturity requirements** - Why is this product or integration suitable for execution right now? Are there enough pieces of infrastructure, applications or other integrations available that would be needed for this suggested proposal to have a strong chance of gaining adoption? For instance, if you were making a professional social network DApp, do the right identity tools and wallets exist to make a professional network feasible?
