# Overview & Benefits

Funding categories are concerned with how Catalyst allocates funding from the Cardano treasury to different areas in the wider ecosystem. A category helps to group proposals around a certain topic or purpose.

The current [challenge setting process](../background/challenge-setting-approach.md) has a number of issues and complexities that can be avoided by using higher level categories rather than more specific community chosen ones.

The following are the benefits for using broad funding categories to allocate treasury funding.



### More inclusive of ideas

**All ideas are welcomed**

A reason to use broad categories is that they should guarantee that there is funding available for all areas within the ecosystem that would benefit from support. The [categories](categories/) that have been created have been back tested with the previous [existing selected challenges](categories-and-existing-challenges.md).



**Maximises finding promising innovation**

The key issue with making a mandate on where to allocate funds is this does not reflect how innovation works. Putting a mandate that one specific area should receive funding over another does not mean that suitable innovation will turn up in that challenge nor does it mean the proposal team is well suited to its execution. There is also no guarantee of what innovation could emerge from areas that have been rejected. Strong ideas and innovation could come at anytime. By using broad categories to allow any idea to be submitted the ecosystem maximises the chances to invite new innovation. Voters are always still able to pick proposals in that come under a more specific category however by making the funding more inclusive they now have the choice of which proposals to pick.

### **Less complexity**

**Low budget weighting complexity**

By having less categories to allocate funding between the complexity of how to do the budget weighting for each of them decreases. The higher number of categories you have the more information and data you need to justify the decisions for budget weighting as the higher the probability of making restrictive funding to areas of the ecosystem. The categories that have been created help to reduce the complexity of determining what amount should go into each category.

****

**Less category justification**

Another benefit to a low number of categories that cover all forms of ideas means there is less justification as to why the category is used. If you have self determined challenges that can be for any area of the ecosystem it becomes far more complex to be able to justify that choice over all other options that could exist. Funding allocation categorisation that doesn't need to be justified makes the funding process more simple.&#x20;

**Easier governance**

Having less budget weighting and justification complexity means easier governance for the community. Higher level categories means voters only need to indicate what percentage of funds they would prefer to see in each category.

### **Less stakeholder effort**

**Reduced proposer effort**

Proposers currently have to draft up challenge setting proposals and self determine the budget allocation used for a challenge. By moving towards broad categories the proposers within the community benefit from not needing to write proposals for challenges in each funding round. Instead the categories that have been defined fulfil this purpose and the budget weighting selection can become a governance process handled by the community. Proposers also save time from not needing to understand all the different challenge setting briefs each funding round before they write proposals and instead only need to know about the small number of broad categories.



**Reduced voter effort**

Voters would only need to understand a few categories and then vote on the budget weightings for those categories. This saves voter time that can instead be used on selecting proposals. In the challenge setting process voters currently have to read all the challenge settings and also have a good understanding of the ecosystem to be able to vote on one area of the ecosystem over another.



**Reduced community advisor effort**

Broad categories remove the need for community advisors to assess challenge setting proposals and can instead allocate that time and more resources on improving assessments for proposals that are looking for funding. No assessments on challenge setting proposals would also mean no assessment reviews for veteran community advisors.



### **Removes current challenge setting issues**

**Prevents duplicate challenge settings**

Not having the community create multiple challenge settings removed the issues around duplicated challenge settings that causes funding to be more easily over allocated to certain areas.



**Removes challenges created by self interest**

Using an inclusive small number of categories means that challenges can't be created out of self interest to direct more funding opportunities to one group over another.



**Reduces need for challenge team knowledge and deeper ecosystem understanding**

Using broad categories means the community doesn't need to have as deep of an understanding about the ecosystem to make proposals and decisions on funding allocation.

****

**Removes easy entry for malicious actors**

Broad categories removes the possibility for malicious actors to game or break the funding allocation system by writing and promoting challenges that aren't in the best interests of the wider community.
