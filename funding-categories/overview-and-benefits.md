# Overview & Benefits

Funding categories are concerned with how Catalyst allocates funding from the Cardano treasury to different areas in the Cardano ecosystem. A category groups proposals around a certain topic or purpose.

The current [challenge setting process](../background/challenge-setting-approach.md) has a number of issues and complexities that can be avoided by using broad categories rather than more specific community chosen ones.

The following are the benefits for using broad funding categories to allocate treasury funding.



### More inclusive of ideas

**All ideas are welcomed**

A reason to use broad categories is that they should guarantee that there is funding available for all areas within the ecosystem that could benefit from funding support. The [categories](categories/) that have been created have been back tested with the previous [existing selected challenges](categories-and-existing-challenges.md).



**Maximises opportunity to find innovation**

The key issue with making a mandate on where to allocate funds is this does not reflect how innovation works. Putting a mandate that one specific area should receive funding over another does not mean that suitable innovation will turn up in that challenge nor does it mean the proposal team is well suited for its execution. There is also no guarantee of what innovation could emerge from areas that have been rejected for a given funding round. Strong ideas and innovation could come at anytime. By using broad categories that allow any idea to be submitted the ecosystem maximises the chances to invite new innovation. Voters are always able to pick which proposals they want to receive funding meaning the process is fair and the proposal process is inclusive of different ideas.

### **Less complexity**

**Low budget weighting complexity**

Less categories to allocate funding between reduces the complexity of how to do the budget weighting. The higher number of categories you have the more information and data you need to justify the decisions for budget weighting as the probability of being able to make a restrictive funding allocation increases. The suggested categories that have been created to help to reduce the complexity of determining what amount should go into each category which saves every stakeholder in the system time and resources.

**Less category justification**

Another benefit of using a lower number of categories that cover all forms of ideas are that there is less justification as to why the category is used. If you have self determined challenges that can be targeting any area of the ecosystem it becomes increasingly complex to be able to justify that choice over all other options that could exist. Funding allocation categorisation that doesn't need to be justified makes the funding process simpler for all stakeholders involved.&#x20;

**Easier governance**

Having less budget weighting and justification complexity means there is easier governance for the community. Broad categories means voters only need to indicate what percentage of funds they would prefer to see in each category.

### **Less stakeholder effort**

**Reduced proposer effort**

Proposers currently have to draft up challenge setting proposals and self determine the budget allocation used for a challenge. By moving towards broad categories the proposers within the community benefit from not needing to write proposals for challenges in each funding round. Instead the categories that have been defined fulfil this purpose and the budget weighting selection can become a governance process handled by the community. Proposers also save time from not needing to understand all the different challenge setting briefs each funding round every time they go to write proposals and instead only need to know about the smaller number of broad categories.



**Reduced voter effort**

Voters would only need to understand a few categories and then vote on the budget weightings for those categories. This saves voter time that can instead be used on selecting proposals. In the challenge setting process voters currently have to read all the challenge settings and also have a good understanding of the ecosystem to be able to vote on one area of the ecosystem over another. Using broad categories removes this time consuming process and gives the voter more time to spend on voting on proposals.



**Reduced community advisor effort**

Broad categories remove the need for community advisors to assess challenge setting proposals and can instead allocate that time and more resources on improving assessments for proposals that are looking for funding. No assessments on challenge setting proposals would also mean no assessment reviews for veteran community advisors.



### **Removes current challenge setting issues**

**Preventing duplicate challenge settings**

Not creating multiple challenge settings removes the issues around duplicated challenge settings that currently causes the issue of funding being over allocated to certain areas.



**Removes challenges created by self interest**

Using an inclusive smaller number of categories means that challenges can't be created out of self interest to direct more funding to one group over another.



**Reduces need for challenge team knowledge and deeper ecosystem understanding**

Using broad categories means the community doesn't need to have the same depth of understanding about the ecosystem to make well informed decisions on suitable budget weightings for each category. The more categories you introduce the more complex it becomes to make well informed decisions on the budget weighting to apply and for justifying the categories importance.

**Removes easy entry for malicious actors**

Broad categories removes the possibility for malicious actors to try and game or break the funding allocation system by writing and promoting challenges that aren't in the best interests of the wider community.
