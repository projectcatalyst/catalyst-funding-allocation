**Catalyst Contributors**

[Catalyst contributors](https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-contributors/) are a category for people to apply to work full time in the Catalyst ecosystem to support and improve the governance tools and processes used in Catalyst and the wider ecosystem. Proposals in this category are from candidates who would like to be paid to fulfil a certain role.

**Development & Node Operation**

The Development & Node Operation category looks for proposals that will help improve and maintain the Cardano developer ecosystem with tools, scripts, libraries and SDKs that make it easier for developers to build applications. It also looks at supporting stake pool operation with tools and resources that will make it as easy as possible for people to help secure the network by running a stake pool node.

**Cardano Contributors**

[Cardano contributors](https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/cardano-contributors/) are a category for people to apply to work full time in the Cardano ecosystem. This includes those who want to help support improving the stake pool ecosystem and the Cardano developer ecosystem. Contributors would help analyse, coordinate or develop tools, libraries and SDKs for the ecosystem to use. Proposals in this category are from candidates who would like to be paid to fulfil a certain role.

**Nurturing Ideas & Teams**

Nurturing Ideas & Teams is all about exploring how we can help to foster growth for ideas and new teams forming in the ecosystem. Any proposal type is welcomed as long as it is about the Cardano ecosystem in someway. There is a $40,000 maximum budget to increase the number of teams and ideas that can be funded to increase the idea and team diversity.&#x20;

**Catalyst Natives**

Other ecosystem projects can introduce their own funding challenges into the process with their own self determined funding allocation amounts for rewarding proposals.
