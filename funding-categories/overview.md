# Overview

Funding categories provide a simpler and far more effective way to do funding categorisation. Funding categories are recurring, broad and inclusive. The following categories collectively allow for any type of idea or innovation to be submitted.

**Idea & Innovation categories**

Any proposal about an idea or innovation can be submitted in these categories. Examples include events, applications, tools, software libraries, community initiative efforts and many others.



**Contributor categories**

Proposals submitted by people in the community who want to work full time in the ecosystem to support and improve the ecosystem.

**Experimental categories**

Exploration in any new funding categorisation approach to see how it is used so that it can be analysed once used to inform future iterations and improvements.

**Development & Infrastructure**

Development & Infrastructure focuses on proposals that will help improve and maintain the Cardano developer ecosystem with tools, scripts, libraries and SDKs that make it easier for developers to build applications. It also includes infrastructure improvements with tools and resources that will make it as easy as possible for community members to secure and scale the network and run their own infrastructure and stake pool nodes.

**Nurturing Ideas & Teams**

Nurturing Ideas & Teams is about exploring how we can help to foster growth for ideas and new teams forming in the ecosystem. Any proposal type is welcomed as long as it is about the Cardano ecosystem in someway. There is a $40,000 maximum budget for proposals which helps to increase the number and diversity of teams and ideas that can be funded.
